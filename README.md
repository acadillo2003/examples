## DebOps Examples

This is a repository of example [DebOps](http://debops.org/) projects - mostly
Ansible inventories and some additional Bash scripts, when user needs to
perform actions outside Ansible.

Further documentation will be added at a later time.

### Basic examples

* `vagrant-multi-machine`: Using Debops with a multi-machine
  Vagrantfile
* `webhost-gitusers-dokuwiki`: Setting up a Webserver with nginx,
  docuwiki and gituser.
* `testing-roles-rolespec-vagrant`: Setting up a virtual machine
  (using Vagrant) for testing roles using
  [rolespec](https://github.com/nickjj/rolespec)


### Advances examples

* `devlab`: manage a "development lab" on an Ubuntu/Xubuntu host with
   KVM virtual machines guests, which also are LXC hosts for
   containers.

### Other examples

* `vagrant-ansible-single-machine`: Using Ansible (but not debops)
  with a single Vagrant box.
